# Text-Simplifier
Programme to simplify a text file by swapping words out for more commonly used synonyms.

Description
This is a console based application that allows a user to simplify a piece of text loaded in .txt
format. The programme scans all the words in the specified document and simplifies it by
substituting more complex words with synonyms found in the user-supplied list of common
words. The user must provide a text file to simplify, as well as two files for reference: one
containing words and their GloVe embeddings, the other containing a list of common words in
English.

To Run
Access and run the .jar file from the command line, specifying ie.atu.sw.Runner as the path.
Navigate through the Main Menu options to set file-paths of the reference text files.
Then, prompt the programme to Execute, Analyse and Report.
